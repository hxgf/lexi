<h2>fluffer code and helpers for quickly developing internet projects</h2>
<br /><br />
<p>lexxi provides an abstraction layer on top of what would otherwise be a normal express.js stack. most of the tedious technical decisions are made for you (in sensible ways) so can focus on the [application/api/website/community/store/forum] you're trying to create.</p>
<p>documentation forthcoming. quick start at: <a href="https://github.com/hxgf/lexxi/">https://github.com/hxgf/lexxi/</a></p>
