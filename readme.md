## LEXXI 0.2.1

(っ◕‿◕)っ♥

LEXXI is an abstraction layer for quickly developing internet projects with a relatively standard expressjs stack.

the documentation will be available soon, but if you're curious, this should be enough to get you started:

```bash
mkdir cool-new-project && cd $_
```
```bash
npm install lexxi
```
```bash
cp -R node_modules/lexxi/boilerplate/* .
```
```bash
npm install
```
```bash
bower install
```
```bash
gulp dev
```

this series of incantations will produce a reasonably-assembled express app that (obviously) uses gulp to handle tedious parts of the development process. [take a look at the tree structure](https://github.com/hxgf/lexxi/tree/master/boilerplate) and it will seem pretty obvious where [all your application code goes](https://github.com/hxgf/lexxi/tree/master/boilerplate/app).

you can then point your internet browser to http://localhost:3001, where, if all went well, you'll see our friend (っ◕‿◕)っ reaching out to hug a floating heart ♥ (or perhaps the concept of love itself?).

i promise i'll tell you more about this system when the time is right, but now is not that time.

soon, my children, all will be revealed. ssshhhh.
