<p>lexxi <i>(who is not technically a baby robot, btw)</i> provides an abstraction layer on top of what would otherwise be a normal express.js stack. most of the tedious technical decisions are made for you (in sensible ways) so you can focus on the [ web application / rest api / website / community / store / forum / (and any combination thereof) ] you're trying to create.</p>
<p>documentation will be available soon, i promise. read the quick start guide on github: <a href="https://github.com/hxgf/lexxi/">https://github.com/hxgf/lexxi/</a></p>
