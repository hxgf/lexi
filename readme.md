## LEXXI 0.0.2

LEXXI is abstraction layer for quickly developing internet projects with a relatively standard expressjs stack.

we're working on the documentation, but this should be enough to get you started:

```bash
mkdir cool-new-project && cd $_
```
```bash
npm install lexxi
```
```bash
cp -R node_modules/lexxi/boilerplate/* .
```
```bash
npm install
```
```bash
bower install
```
```bash
gulp dev
```

this sets up a pretty normal express app that (obviously) uses gulp to handle tedious parts of the dev process. take a look at the tree structure and it will seem pretty obvious where all your application code goes.

i promise i'll tell you more about this when the time is right. ssshhhh.
