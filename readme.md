## LEXI
Fluffer code and helpers for quickly developing internet projects with a relatively standard express.js stack.


we're working on the documentation, but this should be enough to get you started:

```bash
mkdir cool-new-project && cd $_
```
```bash
npm install lexxi
```
```bash
cp -R node_modules/lexxi/boilerplate/* .
```
```bash
npm install
```
```bash
bower install
```
```bash
gulp dev
```

this sets up a pretty normal express app. take a look at the tree structure and it will seem pretty obvious where all your application code goes...i promise i'll tell you more about it when the time is right. ssshhhh.
