## LEXI
Fluffer code and helpers for quickly developing internet projects with a relatively standard express.js stack.



Documentation is forthcoming, but this should be enough to get you started:
```bash
mkdir cool-new-project && cd $_
npm install lexxi
cp -R node_modules/lexxi/boilerplate/* .
npm install
bower install
gulp dev
```


then treat it as normal express app. put all your application code in the "app" folder...it will all make sense as soon as you see the file structure, i promise :)
