## LEXXI 0.0.2

LEXXI is an abstraction layer for quickly developing internet projects with a relatively standard expressjs stack.

the documentation will be available soon, but if you're curious, this should be enough to get you started:

```bash
mkdir cool-new-project && cd $_
```
```bash
npm install lexxi
```
```bash
cp -R node_modules/lexxi/boilerplate/* .
```
```bash
npm install
```
```bash
bower install
```
```bash
gulp dev
```

this series of incantations will produce a reasonable express app that (obviously) uses gulp to handle tedious parts of the dev process. take a look at the tree structure and it will seem pretty obvious where all your application code goes.

i promise i'll tell you more about this system when the time is right. now is not that time. don't panic. ssshhhh.
